Project Members: Derek Li
Project Name: Grocery Guessing Game
Tier Level: Beginner
Project Description: This website is a small guessing game where you are given two common grocery store items and are asked to compare the price
between the two.

Timeline:

Friday: I brainstormed the idea for the project and planned out the basic implementation details / steps I would need to perform to implement the
project. Additionally, I got my work environment set up.

Saturday: I fully implemented what I could for my project and at least got a working version of it created and then hosted the website online.
